# Scripts 

This is for processing a copy of the release version of the C24 dataset.

Note that these are a recreation of the commands originally used to process the dataset for this analysis, so there may be differences.

In this folder: 
- First write_c24_processing.py is run to write a list of processing commands. 
- Then the written script is manually updated to use the right location for accProcess.py. 
- Then write_cluster_script_basic_processing.sh is run to write a cluster submission script based off these commands.

Other files in this folder are generated by these steps.
